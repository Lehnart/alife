# ALife

## Introduction

This repository is here to share different projects on artificial life (Alife in short).
It is essentially cellular automata model but you could find also L-systems, artificial intelligence stuff, physic simulations, etc.

## Compilation

This code has only been tested on Ubuntu (via WSL). You will need SDL2 library in order to compile.

You can use cmake :

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release /PATH/TO/alife/src
cmake --build  /PATH/TO/BUILD/DIRECTORY -- -j 4
```

This will build all the executables.

## Results

Most of what you will see running the executables is available on you tube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChY4IYtdU-VI7gHuRAEnzlA
